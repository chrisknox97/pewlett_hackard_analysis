<img align="right" src="https://github.com/chrisknox97/pewlett_hackard_analysis/blob/main/Additional_PNG/retirement_count.png">

* Pewlett-Hackard should expect, in the imminent future, an influx of retirements in two departments: ``Senior Engineer`` and ``Senior Staff``. 

* Pewlett-Hackard does not have enough ``Engineers`` (9,285) nor ``Staff`` (7,636) to simply promote and replace their retiring ``Senior Engineers`` (25,916) and ``Senior Staff`` (24,926); let alone the dearth such a move would create in the now vacant ``Engineer`` and ``Staff`` positions. 

* Pewlett-Hackard should not expect many ``Managers`` to retire in the imediate future, with only two employees meeting such criteria. 

### Mentorship Elgibility 

Faced with a high rate of impending retirements, Pewlett-Hackard must ensure that its future employees can maintain the same level of productivity throughout its upcoming transition period. As such, Pewlett-Hackard's ``.CSV`` files for ``Employees``, ``Department of Employees`` and ``Titles`` were combined to create a single table from which we could analyze potential mentorships. The results of this analysis are as follows:

![Mentorship_Count](https://github.com/chrisknox97/pewlett_hackard_analysis/blob/main/Additional_PNG/mentorship_count.png)

* Pewlett-Hackard has only 1,549 potential mentees while it is potentially losing 25 times that in both its ``Senior Engineer`` and ``Senior Staff`` Departments alone. 

* Pewlett Hackard's greatest batch of potential mentees is in its ``Staff`` Department (436) with the ``Engineering`` Department having 291 potential mentees; both drastically below necessary replacemnt levels.
